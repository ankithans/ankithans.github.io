<p>My experience with <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> and my organisation <strong>Aerogear</strong>(JBoss) has been so great till now, learning new things everyday has really became a part of my life.</p>
<p>It has been almost 2 months since I got into the program, but it feels like tomorrow! When I started contributing or writing proposal, I was like zero in golang, but comparing then and now, it&rsquo;s different. In this journey I got to know about some great concepts in golang and again many yet to be explored!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My favorite part about the Google Summer of Code is you work on projects are are used or will be used in the industry, and this feeling makes you keep going. We have integrated some features and are planning to integrate <a href="https://github.com/aerogear/charmil">Charmil framework</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-cli/">RHOAS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-cli">Apicurio</a> CLI&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Need to achieve much bigger targets/goals in coming coding period! Let&rsquo;s hope for the best ðŸ¤ž</p>

<p>I have talked about Charmil ie. my GSoC project, in my previous blog, but this framework keeps on refining each day and there are some info&rsquo;s that needs to be updated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So <strong>Charmil is a Framework for building command line plugins on the top of Cobra golang library</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cobra is standard and very famous in the CLI industry and is being used in many industry projects such as Kubernetes, rhoas, gh-cli, etc. To make the development process easier we introduced Charmil.</p>
<p>Charmil solves many problems/issues faced by developers during development of CLI&rsquo;s. The major feature that Charmil brings on the table is the <strong>ability to develop multiple fragmented CLI&rsquo;s, maintained/working in separate repositories, and later embed/combine them in a single Host CLI</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Charmil SDK</strong> - For building mutlirepo CLI&rsquo;s</li>
<li><strong>Charmil Validator</strong> - Cobra Testing Library</li>
<li><strong>Charmil CLI</strong> - Creating starter and managing CLI project</li>
<li><strong>Charmil Command Registry</strong> - Install CLI plugins with binary from maintained registry</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="charmil-validator">Charmil Validator</h2>
<p>This is the charmil library for <strong>testing and controlling many aspects of cobra commands</strong>. Like to test react components we have react-testing-library, similar to that to test cobra commands with some given set of customizable rules, we have charmil validator.</p>
<p>Validator provides a customizable set of config attributes, for example -</p>

<ul>
<li>LengthRule</li>
<li>MustExistRule</li>
<li>UseMatchesRule</li>
<li>ExampleMatchesRule</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to use Charmil Validator while writing unit tests for the cobra commands. Validator can check if the commands are <strong>providing proper and latest documentation</strong>, <strong>length and presence of attributes</strong>, <strong>regex matching for command names</strong> etc. It also provides the feature to <em>skip some command or skip including children for validation</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">validationErr</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">rules</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">ExecuteRules</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">cmd</span>, <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">ruleCfg</span>)

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Skipping commands for validation is very easy. To skip a single command just provide the CommandPath and to skip the entire chain of commands(including subcommands/children) use a asterik sign immediately after CommandPath</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">ValidatorOptions</span>: <span style="color:#a6e22e">rules</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">ValidatorOptions</span>{

<p>I have been maintaining a <strong>Project Tracker</strong> to record the entire process in GSoC and making up of Charmil framework from scratch. Feel free to check it out at <a href="https://ankithans.github.io/gsoc21/">https://ankithans.github.io/gsoc21/</a></p>
<h2 id="what-i-have-learnt-or-still-learning">What I have learnt or still learning</h2>
<p>Some of these I got from my mentor&rsquo;s feedbacks and others are just my experiences</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicate more and more</strong>, even if you are stuck somewhere for long. Communication is the key here</li>
<li><strong>Regularly push code</strong> and ask for reviews</li>
<li>Focus more on the end users and problems, not just code it first then think. Try to <strong>follow docs first approach</strong></li>
<li>Again Communicate more before PR&rsquo;s</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852928325197234256/852932535117545482/unknown.png" alt="github-timline"></p>
<p>I myself started with <strong>opensource</strong> in end of the year 2020. Explored a lot of organizations, according to my interest and tech-stack. And I got a list of 20+ orgs, so I took my time, may be a week and gone through the projects of all of them. Then finally I found <a href="https://librehealth.io/">LibreHealth</a> and <a href="https://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a>.</p>
<p>I started my opensource journey with <a href="https://librehealth.io/">LibreHealth</a>. The project was <a href="https://gitlab.com/librehealth/toolkit/cost-of-care/lh-toolkit-cost-of-care-app">Cost of Care Application</a> which aims to to provide patient friendly costs of care, to help patients get better cost estimates for medical procedures of Hospitals.</p>
<p>I knew <a href="https://flutter.dev/">flutter</a> before hand and so I did solve some issues and improvements. As I became active member in the <a href="https://forums.librehealth.io/">LibreHealth community</a> the admins gave me <code>new user of the month</code> badge, after some days they promoted my trust level on their forums and this really encouraged me to contribute more to open-source! The maintainers were quick in reviewing my merge requests and this filled me with confidence and persuaded me to apply for GSoC this year.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-journey-started-with-jboss">How the Journey started with JBoss</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813051031645847597/852977521049206795/Group_2.png" alt="gsoc-with-jboss"></p>
<p>After a great kickstart in the journey of opensource, I found a project <a href="https://github.com/aerogear/graphql-link">graphql-link</a> in <strong>Aerogear(JBoss)</strong>. I knew that it was a Golang project overall(PS: I didn&rsquo;t knew how to print hello world in golang), but there were some beginner friendly issues in the repository, like website for documentation(<a href="https://docusaurus.io/">docusaurus</a>), example servers etc.</p>
<p>I started resolving some good-first issues and got in touch with my mentor <a href="https://github.com/wtrocki">Wojciech Trocki</a>. He persuaded me to learn golang and contribute more. I am so glad to have a mentor like him. He helps in every way possible, like giving hints, code reviews, appreciations, guidance etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>After my proposal got selected in JBoss, I got this from my mentor at LibreHealth</strong> and I was in seventh heaven ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©</p>

<h2 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h2>
<p>There are typically two types of projects in open-source.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Project is already there on internet. You need to develop, propose and fix on the top of that.</li>
<li>The idea is validated on paper, but still it&rsquo;s not on internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>My project comes in second category, I have to start everything from the ground level, deciding the architecture, code structure and documentation. In my opinion, this is a little harder to do than the projects in first category. 
You may think, you can decide the code structure and other things without any restrictions. But if you are not experienced enough then you might fail in doing this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to decide design/architecture is -</p>
<ul>
<li>get the thorough idea of the project, then try to think by yourself</li>
<li>show it to your mentor for validation</li>
<li>improve it from the feedbacks provided and repeat this cycle until you and your mentor is satisfied by the design.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-my-project">About my Project</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852928325197234256/852951299501850634/unknown.png" alt="charmil"></p>
<p>The project on which I will be working throughout this summer is <strong><a href="https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/">Charmil</a></strong>. A Golang based Framework on the top of <a href="https://cobra.dev/">cobra</a> which will help the developers to create CLI&rsquo;s as Plugins and later they can be installed/imported into any CLI. This can be achieved with a package manager similar to npm, apt, pip etc.</p>
<p>The user will import charmil in their CLI, which will provide them all the extensions out of the box. The user will be able to install specific plugins with the install command. After installing the extension, users will be able to use the features of that plugin without writing code for that particular feature which that plugin provides.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a SDK + CLI kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine working on something big like this own my own. That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> gave me the platform and my mentors who are always there to support me.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-it-going">How is it going?</h2>
<p>I would say learning wise it&rsquo;s going truly awesome, I learn new stuffs daily while working. <strong>Most important skill I got is plan before code.</strong> This really helps in using the time effectively. Whenever I am stuck, I like to write that up in notion or github(depends), and it always leads me from nowhere to somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="week-1-report">Week 1 report</h3>
<ul>
<li>Misunderstood some requirements of POC and explored how external CLI&rsquo;s with binary can be used as plugins <a href="https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/pull/37">#37</a></li>
<li>Implemented correct wrapper approach according to the requirements <a href="https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/pull/45">#45</a></li>
<li>Compared how wrapper and 2nd(plugin&rsquo;s use cobra) approaches are different, what do we loose/gain in wrapper approach <a href="https://github.com/aerogear/charmil/discussions/43#discussioncomment-851017">link</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-week">Next Week</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get the architecture of the final approach ready and move to 2nd phase</li>
<li>Decide specific initial features and start implementing and documenting</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blockers">Blockers</h3>
<ul>
<li>What validation do we do when we implement other than wrapper approach?</li>
<li>Once the POC is ready then it should be easy to move with features</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-source-projects-vs-personal-projects">Open Source Projects vs Personal Projects</h2>
<p>There is huge debate on this topic on internet. But according to me, <strong>open-source projects are much more worth than personal projects</strong>. While working on OSS projects, you will be exploring the unknown code written by some engineer. You will collaborate with other open-source developers. Most of the project maintainers work full time in big tech companies and working with them will be a huge plus and you will get familiar with the industrial work.</p>
<p>All this above has been personally experienced by me in past months.</p>
