My experience with Google Summer of Code and my organisation Aerogear(JBoss) has been so great till now, learning new things everyday has really became a part of my life.
It has been almost 2 months since I got into the program, but it feels like tomorrow! When I started contributing or writing proposal, I was like zero in golang, but comparing then and now, it&amp;rsquo;s different. In this journey I got to know about some great concepts in golang and again many yet to be explored!</description></item><item><title>GSoC'21 journey begins</title><link>https://ankithans.github.io/posts/2021/06/gsoc21-journey-begins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankithans.github.io/posts/2021/06/gsoc21-journey-begins/</guid><description>Get started with open-source I myself started with opensource in end of the year 2020.

Then finally I found LibreHealth and JBoss.
I started my opensource journey with LibreHealth. The project was Cost of Care Application which aims to to provide patient friendly costs of care, to help patients get better cost estimates for medical procedures of Hospitals.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ankithans.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankithans.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi üëã, I am Ankit Hans I am a ‚ú® Full Stack Developer, üíª Open Source enthusiast and I love building great and cool stuffs for the community.
