My experience with Google Summer of Code and my organisation Aerogear(JBoss) has been so great till now, learning new things everyday has really became a part of my life.
It has been almost 2 months since I got into the program, but it feels like tomorrow! When I started contributing or writing proposal, I was like zero in golang, but comparing then and now, it&amp;rsquo;s different. In this journey I got to know about some great concepts in golang and again many yet to be explored!</description></item><item><title>GSoC'21 journey begins</title><link>https://ankithans.github.io/posts/2021/06/gsoc21-journey-begins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ankithans.github.io/posts/2021/06/gsoc21-journey-begins/</guid><description>Get started with open-source I myself started with opensource in end of the year 2020. Explored a lot of organizations, according to my interest and tech-stack. And I got a list of 20+ orgs, so I took my time, may be a week and gone through the projects of all of them. Then finally I found LibreHealth and JBoss.
I started my opensource journey with LibreHealth. The project was Cost of Care Application which aims to to provide patient friendly costs of care, to help patients get better cost estimates for medical procedures of Hospitals.</description></item></channel></rss>
